# SocialDen

SocialDen is a WordPress framework plugin (think [BuddyPress][1]) that aims to be your new social home, one that gives you full control over your data, your privacy, and your face to the world while providing interoperability with your current social networks in a native, extensible way.

Current social networks are siloed, tucking away all the data you create for them to monetize in the form of advertisements and marketing. Social networks should be a part of the web, and SocialDen wants to make it easy enough for regular users to own their piece of it as well as flexible enough for developers to write plugins and themes to make their home look exactly the way they want.

## Proposed Features and Functionality

To begin, SocialDen is developing the admin interface, consisting of a TweetDeck-inspired interface for viewing and post to your social streams for Twitter, Facebook, and (hopefully) Tumblr. The goal is for this interface to begin to help you pull your data into your blog and form the foundation for the framework.

Eventually, framework will provide a structured way to allow users to work with whichever networks they're already on, including native features like sharing, retweeting, and reblogging, as well as communicate with other users of the plugin framework directly.

## Goals

The goal is to provide a transitionary framework to take back control of our networks without reliquishing our space or being reliant on them.
